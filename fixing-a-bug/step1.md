## Install ansible-base

To use Ansible we need to have it installed. This will also install any required dependencies.

Install the `ansible-base` package (which includes `ansible-playbook` and `ansible-test`)

`pip install ansible-base`{{execute}}

Ansible 2.10 is the first that properly supports Collections:

`ansible --version`{{execute}}
